To meet the refined requirements for system operation and maintenance monitoring as well as user account management, especially addressing practical issues currently faced by RAGFlow users, such as "the inability of users to recover lost passwords on their own" and "difficulty in effectively controlling account statuses," RAGFlow has officially launched a professional back-end management command-line tool.

This tool is based on a clear client-server architecture. By adopting the design philosophy of functional separation, it constructs an efficient and reliable system management channel, enabling administrators to achieve system recovery and permission control at the fundamental level. 

The specific architectural design is illustrated in the following diagram: 

![]()

Through this tool, RAGFlow users can gain a one-stop overview of the operational status of the RAGFlow Server as well as components such as MySQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, MinIO, and Infinity. It also supports comprehensive user lifecycle management, including account creation, status control, password reset, and data cleanup.

## Start the service

If you deploy RAGFlow via Docker, please modify the `docker/docker_compose.yml` file and add parameters to the service startup command.

```
command:
  - --enable-adminserver
```

If you are deploying RAGFlow from the source code, you can directly execute the following command to start the management server:

```
python3 admin/server/admin_server.py
```

After the server starts, it listens on port 9381 by default, waiting for client connections. If you need to use a different port, please modify the `ADMIN_SVR_HTTP_PORT` configuration item in the `docker/.env file`.

## Install the client and connect to the management service

It is recommended to use pip to install the specified version of the client:

```
pip install ragflow-cli==0.21.0
```

Version `0.21.0` is the current latest version. Please ensure that the version of `ragflow-cli` matches the version of the RAGFlow server to avoid compatibility issues:

```
ragflow-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9381
```

Here, `-h` specifies the server IP, and `-p` specifies the server port. If the server is deployed at a different address or port, please adjust the parameters accordingly.

For the first login, enter the default administrator password `admin`. After successfully logging in, it is recommended to promptly change the default password in the command-line tool to enhance security.

## Command Usage Guide

By entering the following commands through the client, you can conveniently manage users and monitor the operational status of the service.

**Interactive Feature Description**

- Supports using arrow keys to move the cursor and review historical commands.
- Pressing `Ctrl+C` allows you to terminate the current interaction at any time.
- If you need to copy content, please avoid using `Ctrl+C` to prevent accidentally interrupting the process.

**Command Format Specifications**

- All commands are case-insensitive and must end with a semicolon `;`.
- Text parameters such as usernames and passwords need to be enclosed in single quotes `'` or double quotes `"`.
- Special characters like `\`, `'`, and `"` are prohibited in passwords.

### Service Management Commands

`LIST SERVICES;`

- List the operational status of RAGFlow backend services and all associated middleware.

**Usage Example**

```
admin> list services;

```

The user has been successfully disabled. Only users in a **disabled** state can be deleted.

`DROP USER <username>;`

- Delete the user and all their associated data
- `<username>`: User email address

**Important Notes:**

- Only **disabled** users can be deleted.
- Before proceeding, ensure that all necessary data such as knowledge bases and files that need to be retained have been transferred to other users.
- This operation will permanently delete the following user data:

![]()

All knowledge bases created by the user, uploaded files, and configured agents, as well as files uploaded by the user in others' knowledge bases, will be permanently deleted. This operation is irreversible, so please proceed with extreme caution.

- The deletion command is **idempotent**. If the system fails or the operation is interrupted during the deletion process, the command can be re-executed after troubleshooting to continue deleting the remaining data.

**Usage Example:**

1. User Successfully Deleted

```
admin> drop user "example@ragflow.io";
Drop user: example@ragflow.io
Successfully deleted user. Details:
Start to delete owned tenant.
- Deleted 2 tenant-LLM records.

## Follow-up plan

We are always committed to enhancing the system management experience and overall security. Building on its existing robust features, the RAGFlow back-end management tool will continue to evolve. In addition to the current efficient and flexible command-line interface, we are soon launching a professional system management UI, enabling administrators to perform all operational and maintenance tasks in a more secure and intuitive graphical environment.

To strengthen permission control, the system status information currently visible in the ordinary user interface will be revoked. After the future launch of the professional management UI, access to the core operational status of the system will be restricted to administrators only. This will effectively address the current issue of excessive permission exposure and further reinforce the system's security boundaries.

In addition, we will also roll out more fine-grained management features sequentially, including:

- Fine-grained control over Datasets and Agents
- User Team collaboration management mechanisms
- Enhanced system monitoring and auditing capabilities

These improvements will establish a more comprehensive enterprise-level management ecosystem, providing administrators with a more all-encompassing and convenient system control experience.
