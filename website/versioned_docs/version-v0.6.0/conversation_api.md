Here, only the task descriptions of the benchmark tasks are fed into LLMs (additional information, such as the input prompt and LLMs\u2019 outputs, is provided in Fig. A.4 and A.5 in supplementary). Broadly speaking, closed-source LLMs demonstrate superior performance on OpenAGI tasks, with GPT-4 leading the pack under both zero- and few-shot scenarios. In the open-source category, LLaMA-2-13B takes the lead, consistently posting top results across various learning schema--the performance possibly influenced by its larger model size. Notably, open-source LLMs significantly benefit from the tuning methods, particularly Fine-tuning and\u2019 RLTF. These methods mark noticeable enhancements for Flan-T5-Large, Vicuna-7B, and LLaMA-2-13B when compared with zero-shot and few-shot learning schema. In fact, each of these open-source models hits its pinnacle under the RLTF approach. Conclusively, with RLTF tuning, the performance of LLaMA-2-13B approaches that of GPT-3.5, illustrating its potential.",

            "content_with_weight": "5.5 Experimental Analysis\nThe main experimental results are tabulated in Tab. 1 and 2, showcasing the results for closed-source and open-source LLMs, respectively. The overall performance is calculated as the average of CLlP\n8\nBERT and ViT scores. Here, only the task descriptions of the benchmark tasks are fed into LLMs (additional information, such as the input prompt and LLMs\u2019 outputs, is provided in Fig. A.4 and A.5 in supplementary). Broadly speaking, closed-source LLMs demonstrate superior performance on OpenAGI tasks, with GPT-4 leading the pack under both zero- and few-shot scenarios. In the open-source category, LLaMA-2-13B takes the lead, consistently posting top results across various learning schema--the performance possibly influenced by its larger model size. Notably, open-source LLMs significantly benefit from the tuning methods, particularly Fine-tuning and\u2019 RLTF. These methods mark noticeable enhancements for Flan-T5-Large, Vicuna-7B, and LLaMA-2-13B when compared with zero-shot and few-shot learning schema. In fact, each of these open-source models hits its pinnacle under the RLTF approach. Conclusively, with RLTF tuning, the performance of LLaMA-2-13B approaches that of GPT-3.5, illustrating its potential.",
