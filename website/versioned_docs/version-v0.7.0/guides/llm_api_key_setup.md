You have two ways to input your LLM API key. 

## Before Starting The System

In **user_default_llm** of [service_conf.yaml](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow/blob/main/docker/service_conf.yaml), you need to specify LLM factory and your own _API_KEY_. 
RAGFlow supports the flowing LLMs, with more coming in the pipeline:

- [Baichuan](https://www.baichuan-ai.com/home)
- [VolcEngine](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379)
